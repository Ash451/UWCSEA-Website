  <h5 class="text-left text-capitalize text-success"> Welcome to UWCSEA  </h5>
        <p class="text-left text-muted"> Here in Singapore, UWCSEA has a unique history: as we build on the impact of our work of over close to 50 years, and as our alumni go out into the world in increasing numbers, we have much to celebrate.

            We are a united, welcoming community that embraces students and their families from almost 100 different nations. The second member of the UWC movement, the College was opened by Lee Kuan Yew as Singapore International School in 1971. SIS became the United World College of South East Asia in 1975 and gradually expanded to become the K–12 international school of over 5,500 students across two campuses that it is today.
            
            Our community, while large, celebrates and builds on the success of individuals, with an aim to create a wider impact through our mission. UWCSEA  embodies everything the UWC movement stands for: concern and compassion for others, the willingness to accept responsibility, and tenacity in pursuit of the truth. What also distinguishes our students is how much they give service to others: their compassion and commitment are writ large in the many hundreds of hours of impactful service the College bears witness to every year, across a hugely diverse range of activities, and which we celebrate as much as our academic achievements.</p>

    </div>
   
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book"></span> Learning at UWC</span>  <br>
      
    <p> As both the starting point and the end goal of a UWCSEA education, our mission guides every decision made at the College. From our mission springs our educational goal, which is to provide a holistic, values-based education that supports our students to develop as individuals and as members of a global society.

            Our wellbeing and learning principles help us to create an environment in which our students can develop knowledge and understanding through the five elements of the UWCSEA learning programme. 
            
            The learning programme at UWCSEA consists of five interlinking elements: academics, activities, outdoor education, personal and social education, and service. While students do not spend an equal amount of time on each of the elements (for much of the year, the academic element takes up most of their day), we place equal value on them. 
            
            The programme strives to give each student age-appropriate opportunities to develop qualities and skills that we have identified as necessary for them to fulfil our educational goal—and therefore our mission.
            
            Education as a force:


            We genuinely believe that education is a force that can lead to positive change in the world and a better future for all. This has led us to our guiding statements, so that a UWCSEA education will empower our students to translate that force into individual and collective action that fulfill our mission. 
            
            As members of the UWC community who are committed to a shared mission, we are compelled to work together towards a peaceful and sustainable future. In order to make a meaningful contribution our community strives to understand complex concepts like peace and sustainability, by unpacking some of the key concepts held within them. 
            
            These often entail complex and difficult conversations, because building positive peace doesn’t necessarily mean avoiding conflict, and sustainability is about much more than simply switching off lights and using recycled paper. To build a sustainable future, we understand that our students will need to know how to think systemically, and to understand concepts like the circular economy, while balancing complex ideas around uniting people and cultures. In a community as diverse as ours, which translates in a mirror of the complex globalised world we live in, our learning programme is carefully constructed to prepare our students to create a shared future which values diverse voices.

        <h4>Airplanes are terrible for the environment. Could Airbus’s redesign change that?</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">Air travel is a major contributor to global warming, and emissions from the industry are growing at an alarming rate. It’s become abundantly clear that something drastic needs to be done to make plans more sustainable.

Airbus is trying to do something about that. The airline has plans to introduce planes that are free of carbon emissions in 2035, the year one study calls the “point of no return” to address global warming. The zero emission aircraft would be powered by hydrogen, which emits water rather than carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when burned.

In recent years, some airlines have made efforts to become more sustainable through carbon offsets and increased fuel efficiency, but when it comes to relative size and impact, those efforts are a drop in the bucket, especially considering that demand for air travel is expected to grow. Airbus itself has 12,000 airliners in operation—and it expects global air passenger traffic to double by the 2030s.

            <p>At Deepdean School for Girls, Daisy Wells and Hazel Wong have set up their own detective agency. But they are struggling to find any real crimes to investigate. (Unless you count the case of Lavinia's missing tie. Which they don't.)

Then Hazel discovers the Science Mistress, Miss Bell, lying dead in the Gym. To add to the mystery, when she and Daisy return five minutes later, the body has disappeared. Now Hazel and Daisy not only have a murder to solve: they have to prove one happened in the first place.

Determined to get to the bottom of the crime before the killer strikes again Hazel and Daisy must hunt for evidence, spy on their suspects and use all the cunning and intuition they can muster. But will they succeed? And can their friendship stand the test?
